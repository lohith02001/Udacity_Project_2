# Udacity_Project_2
In order to run this project you need to have an API_KEY, you can get an API_KEY from here https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup
Once you have the API_KEY, please add it in the API_KEY final string in com.example.lram.moviesapplication.network.MovieAppUtils.
I have added TODO tag for this so that you can search for it and add your API_KEY
